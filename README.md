# Pixel Art Maker Project
This project was made for the Intro to Programming course on Udacity.
The object of the project was to create a webpage that allows users to create a
grid of desired height and width.
After creating the grid the user can then change the colors of each box
in the grid with whatever color is selected. Thus making a canvas on which the
user can make art!
